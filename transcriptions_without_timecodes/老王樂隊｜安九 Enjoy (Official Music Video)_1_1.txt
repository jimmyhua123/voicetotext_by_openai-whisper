 There's no trace of fate In our face Those who are in love We don't need to hide Our youth White My courage speaks above undeteering, evitation of them The tears of those whois√©s I do not care, but gotta defeat our enemy Don't know where you are Don't know where you are Don't know where you are Don't know where you are Don't know where you are In a happy way Every wound of the thread on our face But those are the things We are not going to hide our emotions In the happy and sad days, We are all on our face But those are the times we are not going to hide our emotions We are all on our face We are all on our face
